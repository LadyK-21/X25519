# Fast Implementation of RFC-7748 for 64-bit Architectures
----

This project provides a fast implementation of the 
RFC-7748. The Diffie-Hellman functions known as X25519 and X448.

Features:
 * This code is optimized for the 4th generation of Intel Core processors.
 * Efficient integer multiplier using MULX instruction.
 * Additions accelerated with ADCX/ADOX instructions.
 * Key generation uses a precomputed table of 8 KB.
